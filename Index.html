    <h2>Who is Sergey Brin? </h2>
        <p>
            Sergey Brin was born on August 21, 1973,
            in Moscow, Russia. Brin moved to Adelphi,
            Maryland in the United States during the
            late 1970’s when he was 6 years old. He
            then became a student at the University
            of Maryland where his father had worked
            as a mathematics professor. Brin earned
            degrees in both computer science and
            mathematics. It only took him 3 years
            to graduate with highest honors in both
             mathematics and computer science.

            After he joined Stanford’s graduate program
            where he met Larry Page a fellow graduate 
            student. Both wanted to enhance what it meant
            to extract the meaning of mass data accumulation.
            They began to work on a solution from pages dorm.
            The device they wanted to create was a new type
            of search technology. They first started with
            data mining but soon found that creating a search
            engine was going to be far more useful than data
            mining with the internet expanding. This technology
            we know today is “Google”. They first wanted to
            name it “googol” which is a math term for the 
            number 1, but it was named google from a misspelling.
            By the mid 1999’s they were processing 500,000 
            queries a day. The algorithm that’s the foundation
            of google is called PageRank. It helps link pages
            to each other.
